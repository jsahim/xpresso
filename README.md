## Learning Goals:

My primary goal was to utilize all new skills and technologies that I have acquired this mod. I wrote E2E testing with Cypress, used React hooks, Router, fetch calls, Git workflow and deployed through Vercel.

## Technologies Used:
[//]: <>
- Fetch API
- Webpack
- Cypress E2E Testing
- React Framework
- Router v5
- GitHub Issues & Project Board
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML & JSX

## Wins and Challenges:

- This was possibly the most challanging project to date, but I truly feel that this is where I cross the threshold into feeling like a real developer.

- A challange was that my API data kept changing, but it led to me figuring out how to build in error handling to prevent my code from breaking what a change is made.

- It was a quick turn around for this project, but I do feel proud of what I have accomplished in such a short period of time.
